### Introduction to my profile

My name is Emre Sezgin. I was born in Melbourne, Victoria and now i reside in Brisbane, Queensland. At the moment i am undertaking a bachelor of IT and my up to date education is high school which i just graduated last year. Even though i grew up in Melbourne my nationality is Turkish. An interesting fact about me is that even though i love Holdens very much and own one myself, I was very close to buying a Ford and ruining my loyalty to Holden, sadly i am also devastated that the great lion will not be with us any longer.









# What interests me in IT?
What interests me a lot in IT is its diversity. IT is everywhere and so is the oppurtunities. With IT i could find oppurtunities in health, education, law enforcement,aviation and so the list goes on. With IT the possibilities are limitless and each day the IT sector grows. And i want to be a part of that growth. I want to make a difference with IT. I want to help people and make peoples lives a little bit more easier and less complicated with the skills i learn.  And making a difference dosent seem that hard thanks to the technology that evolves everyday. But for me to make that difference i have to learn and adapt as well. That is why i am here today.




## Why RMIT?
RMIT has always been a university that i wanted to study in. My parents also studied at RMIT and it is also native to the best city in Australia. And IT is in the name of the university.
