### Introduction to my profile

My name is Emre Sezgin. I was born in Melbourne, Victoria and now i reside in Brisbane, Queensland. At the moment i am undertaking a bachelor of IT and my up to date education is high school which i just graduated last year. Even though i grew up in Melbourne my nationality is Turkish/Australian, which means i also know turkish as well and a little bit of arabic. An interesting fact about me is that even though i love Holdens very much and own one myself, I was very close to buying a Ford and ruining my loyalty to Holden, sadly i am also devastated that the great lion will not be with us any longer.









# What interests me in IT?
What interests me a lot in IT is its diversity. IT is everywhere and so is the oppurtunities. With IT i could find oppurtunities in health, education, law enforcement,aviation and so the list goes on. With IT the possibilities are limitless and each day the IT sector grows. And i want to be a part of that growth. I want to make a difference with IT. I want to help people and make peoples lives a little bit more easier and less complicated with the skills i learn.  And making a difference dosent seem that hard thanks to the technology that evolves everyday. But for me to make that difference i have to learn and adapt as well. That is why i am here today.




## Why RMIT?
RMIT has always been a university that i wanted to study in. My parents also studied at RMIT and it is also native to the best city in Australia.





# The Job I want.

The ideal job that i want is to be technical ICT officer. Fixing up networks or computers and making sure everyhting is up to date. In this role i will be assissting the school with ICT technologies and making sure everything is up to date. Whether installing new equipment or maintaining and fixing equipment.

The reason why i really love and want this job is becuase i can work anywhere. i could work in a hospital, a police station, airport and even in a  school, which is the example i have given for this assignment. I can even volunteer my skills to charity organisations, making sure that their technology is up to date as well.

But for me to be succesfull for this role i have to upskill myself, I only have a high school certificate and have very minimal knowlodge of IT,so i am far away from where i need to be if i want that career, hopefully this degree will get me there. And maybe later when i have enough skills to do work experience or an internship, I will take that oppurtunity and upgrade myself. And hopefully with these oppurtunities i will reach my goal to becoming an IT technical officer.
